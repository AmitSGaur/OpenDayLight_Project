Recovery-Mechanism for Link-Failure. Implemented using ODL Controller and Mininet.  Tested on using various topologies like Abilene, Diamond , Fattree etc
Forwarding rules to the ODL controller using Python and restconf protocol, which are used for packet forwarding inside OF switches. 
When any link failures happens , the alternative shortest path is selected for forwarding of packets.
